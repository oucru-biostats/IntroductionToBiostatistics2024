Results from a hypothetical trial comparing a new procalcitonin(biomarker)-guided antibiotics administration versus antibiotics administration according to standard of care in patients admitted to hospital with lower respiratory tract infections. The dataset contains data from 442 patients. 

Variables are: 
- patid: Unique patient id
- pct: Procalcitonin, measured at admission
- proADM: proADM (another biomarker), measured at admission
- group: randomized arm: Control or PCT (procalcitonin guidance)
- AByn: antibiotics prescription: yes or no [primary endpoint]
- LOS: Length of hospital stay (days) [secondary endpoint]

Note: The data are a subset from trial data of a real RCT with some noise added to protect the original data.
